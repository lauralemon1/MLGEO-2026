## University policies and student support

### Disability access and accommodations

*Note that this language is taken directly from the Disability Resources for Students website.*

Your experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington (UW) to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please activate your accommodations via myDRS so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact DRS directly to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations. Contact DRS at [disability.uw.edu](https://disability.uw.edu).

### Religious accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for the accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available [here](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). You must request accommodations within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request Form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).

### Academic integrity and student conduct

Academic honesty is vital to our scholarly community. The UW's Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines academic misconduct and outlines prohibited behaviors. <u>All work you submit must be your own, original work (or properly cited).</u> Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of misrepresentation are serious offenses. Examples of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to: cheating on exams or assignments (e.g. using unauthorized notes or online answers), plagiarism (presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own without credit), unauthorized collaboration on individual work, falsifying data, or submitting the same work for multiple classes without permission. Uploading or sharing course materials or assignments to third-party study sites (e.g., Course Hero, Chegg) without instructor permission is also considered academic misconduct.

By being enrolled in this course, you are expected to uphold these standards of integrity. If you are unsure about whether something might violate academic integrity, please ask me before proceeding. Any suspected cases of academic misconduct will be handled in accordance with UW policies and the College of the Environment's procedures. 

### Use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT

The use of AI in coursework is an evolving area. 



### Use of course materials and copyright

I provide course materials (lecture slides, notes, recordings, assignments, exams, etc.) for your personal use. <u>Please do not share or post any course materials online outside our class without explicit permission.</u> These materials are protected by U.S. copyright law and by University policy. This protection means you may not reproduce, distribute, upload, or sell class materials (including your own completed assignments or exam questions) on sites like Chegg, CourseHero, or public repositories. Unauthorized distribution of course content may violate academic conduct rules and may result in University disciplinary action. Sharing your own study notes with classmates is fine; posting instructor-provided materials to a public forum is not.

### Title IX and preventing sexual harassment

The UW is committed to a safe, equitable environment for all students. UW prohibits sex discrimination and sex-based harassment in any form, including sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and discrimination on the basis of sex or gender. Respect for one another is expected at all times in this course. If you or someone you know experiences sexual harassment or assault, know that resources and help are available. You are encouraged to reach out to the UW Title IX Office or a Title IX case manager. To do so, you can make a report at [titleix.washington.edu](https://titleix.washington.edu) or email [titleix@uw.edu](mailto:titleix@uw.edu). They can connect you with support resources and explain options for reporting and resolution.
