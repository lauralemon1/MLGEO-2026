## Objectives

In December 2025, heavy rain, falling over recently burned land, caused debris flows in the North Cascades (e.g., Stehekin, WA). 

Working in your teams, I would like you to assemble ```.ipynb``` and ```.md``` files that provide climatic context (using publicly available data, ideally collected via APIs!) for December's extreme weather event.

- USGS has steam gauge data.
- NOAA (or other sources) provide precipitation data. 
- Consider contextualizing the event by looking at historical information.

## Deadline

You should complete these tasks by **1:30 PM on Friday, January 16**.
