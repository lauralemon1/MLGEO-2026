## Objective(s)

To practice the ```git``` operations we discussed in class.

1. Clone the course repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Add a .md file under the participants directory that contains your:

   - Name
   - Graduation year
   - Major

    Note: Each parameter should be under a ```h2``` heading.

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to the origin. 
5. Submit a pull request.
6. Approve someone else's pull request.

## Notes

In this case, you have *write* access to the repository. However, there will be times where you want to contribute to a project but lack the ability to modify the repository directly. In such cases, you should *fork*, create a branch, make changes, and then submit a pull request. You are welcome to use this so-called ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) workflow for this assignment (i.e., as opposed to cloning the repository directly). 

## Deadline

You should complete these operations before class <u>**on Friday, January 9**</u>.
