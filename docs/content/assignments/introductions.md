## Objective

In order to develop collaborations and, ultimately, assemble groups for the final project, it is important to know something about your fellow students. 

For this assignment, you will assemble **up to two slides** that tell us:

1. Your name.
2. Your department.
3. An aspect of the geosciences that especially interests you.
4. Your long-term goals. 
5. Experiences you may have with AI/ML.

**You will have exactly one minute to present your slides to the class.** I will *strictly* enforce this time limit. 

## Deadline

You should fill out and upload your slides^[I will share the Google Sheets link via Canvas.] by <u>**9:00 AM on Friday, January 9**</u>. You will present your slides in class that day. 

## Follow up

After everyone presents on Friday, you will have one week to assemble groups for the final project.
