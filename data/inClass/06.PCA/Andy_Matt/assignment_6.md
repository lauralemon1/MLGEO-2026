## Variables
- aspect_deg
- area_km2
- zmed_m, zmean_m

## Components need to explain
PC1 = 0.402 which means PC1 explains 40.24% of the variance.
PC2 explains 21.59%.
PC3 explains 19.58%.
PC4 explains 18.56%.
PC5 explains 0.025% (basically nothing).
### Cumulative explained variance
PC1+PC2 is about 0.618 which means first 2 PCs capture 61.84% of the variance.
PC1+PC2+PC3 is about 81.41%
