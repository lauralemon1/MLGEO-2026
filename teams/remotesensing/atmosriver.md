# Analyzing Precipitation at the Stehekin 4 NW Washington in December 2025 

The goal of this was to look at precipitation and river discharge to relate the datasets in order to understand and analyze the extreme weather event that occurred in December 2025. 

In order to visualize this event, data has been pulled from the USGS Stream Gauge and NOAA databases.

## Data Sources

### USGS Stream Gauge Data


In Figure 1 it is shown that discharge peaked On the 9th of December and experienced a secondary peak between the 13th and the 17th of December.

The average discharge of Stehekin River from January to November 2025 was 1184.32 ft^3/s

### NOAA Precipitation Data


In Figure 2 there are peak precipitation dates on the 9th, 13th, and the 17th. 


Figure 3 shows the monthly preciptiation data at Stehekin 4 NW in order to visualize how this compares to the extreme weather event which occurred in December
