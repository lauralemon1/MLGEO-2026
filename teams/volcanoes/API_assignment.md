## API Assignment
In December 2025, the North Cascades experienced heavy rainfall that triggered debris flows in areas that had been recently burned, such as near Stehekin, Washington. Rainfalls run off more quickly rather than seep into the ground after wildfires because the vegetation that were supposed to stabilize the hillslopes is removed and the soils become water-laden. When intense rainfall happened, water mixed with loose soil, ash, and rock on steep slopes form into a fast moving debris flow. The debris flow was further amplified because of the North Cascades mountainous terrain, as gravity and steep channels allowed debris to accelerate downslope into streams and valleys.

### Observation
1. In the first figure, there are two peaks in discharge and stage over the period of 12/10/2025 through 12/16/2025

2. In the second figure shows mean discharge from 12/10 to 12/16 from 2005 to 2025. The mean discharge was the lowest at this site of measurement in 2025. There is also decreasing trend over the 20-year period.
