I have used uv by astral for python environment management and so should you!
Here's the link: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
just follow the instructions and it'll download, install and then you can use it.
I used it in vs code and it just needed a "uv init" command and it makes sure I have the things I need.

More info coming soon...
